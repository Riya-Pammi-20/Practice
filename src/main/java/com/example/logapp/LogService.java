package com.example.logapp;

import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;

// 
// Certainly! Let’s break down the `LogService` class code you provided step by step:

// ### 1. Package Declaration

// ```java
// package com.example.logapp;
// ```
// - This line declares the package for this Java class. 
// - **Package**: A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. In this case, `com.example.logapp` indicates that this class belongs to a logging application under the `com.example` domain. It helps in avoiding naming conflicts and managing code efficiently.

// ### 2. Import Statement

// ```java
// import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
// ```
// - This line imports the `Logger` class from the Log4j library.
// - **Log4j**: Log4j is a logging framework for Java that provides a robust logging mechanism. The `Logger` class is the core component of Log4j, responsible for logging messages at different levels (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, ERROR).

// ### 3. Class Declaration

// ```java
// public class LogService {
// ```
// - This line defines a public class named `LogService`.
// - **Access Modifier**: The `public` modifier indicates that this class can be accessed from other classes and packages.
// - **Class**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. In this context, `LogService` will provide functionality related to logging messages.

// ### 4. Logger Initialization

// ```java
// private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(LogService.class);
// ```
// - This line initializes a static logger instance for the `LogService` class.
// - **Static**: The `static` keyword means that this variable belongs to the class itself rather than any instance of the class. It is shared across all instances.
// - **Final**: The `final` keyword indicates that the `logger` variable cannot be reassigned once it has been initialized.
// - **Logger.getLogger()**: This method retrieves a logger instance associated with the class name (`LogService.class`). The logger is used to log messages that can help in debugging and monitoring application behavior.

// ### 5. Method Declaration

// ```java
// public void generateLog(String message) {
// ```
// - This line declares a public method named `generateLog` that takes a single parameter, `message`, of type `String`.
// - **Method**: A method is a function that defines behavior for the class. In this case, `generateLog` will handle the process of logging a message.

// ### 6. Logging the Message

// ```java
// logger.info(message);
// ```
// - Inside the `generateLog` method, this line calls the `info` method on the `logger` instance.
// - **logger.info(message)**: This method logs the provided `message` at the INFO level, which is typically used for informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at a high level.
// - This means that whenever `generateLog` is called with a string message, that message will be recorded in the application's logs with an INFO log level.

// ### Conclusion

// Putting it all together, the `LogService` class is designed to handle logging within the application. It uses the Log4j framework to create a logger instance that can log messages at the INFO level. When the `generateLog` method is called with a message, that message gets logged, which can be useful for tracking application behavior and troubleshooting issues.

// Here’s a summary of the key points:

// - **Purpose**: The `LogService` class provides a method to generate log messages.
// - **Logging Framework**: It utilizes the Log4j library to manage logging functionality.
// - **Log Level**: The `generateLog` method logs messages at the INFO level, which is suitable for general informational messages about the application's execution.
