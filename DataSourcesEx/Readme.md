Data Sources

    Querying Data Sources


Terraform data sources let you dynamically fetch data from APIs or other Terraform state backends. Examples of data sources include machine image IDs from a cloud provider or Terraform outputs from other configurations. Data sources make your configuration more flexible and dynamic and let you reference values from other configurations, helping you scope your configuration while still referencing any dependent resource attributes. In HCP Terraform, workspaces let you share data between workspaces.
